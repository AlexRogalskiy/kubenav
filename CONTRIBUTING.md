# Contributing

Every contribution to kubenav is welcome, whether it is reporting a bug, submitting a fix, proposing new features or becoming a maintainer. To make contributing to kubenav as easy as possible you will find more details for the development flow in this documentation.

Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kubenav/kubenav/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Report a bug by opening a new issue. Please always include as much details as possible. For example the platform you run kubenav on is always very helpful. A detailed description to reproduce the bug is also very welcome. If you found a critical security issue they should be submitted directly to admin@kubenav.io. New features should also be discussed via issues first. This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal of inspiration. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests.

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

Please also view the [Contributing](https://docs.kubenav.io/contributing/getting-started/) section in our [documentation](https://docs.kubenav.io).
